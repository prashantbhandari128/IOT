# IoT Physical Servers and Cloud Offering

## IoT Physical Servers
IoT devices generate vast amounts of data, which need to be processed, stored, and analyzed efficiently. IoT physical servers provide the infrastructure to handle these tasks and can be deployed on-premises or in a data center. Key characteristics of IoT servers include:

- **Scalability:** Able to handle increasing numbers of IoT devices and the corresponding data.
- **Reliability:** Ensures consistent performance with minimal downtime.
- **Latency Management:** Optimizes real-time data processing and transmission.
- **Data Storage:** Facilitates local storage for critical data processing and temporary caching.

### Types of Physical Servers
- **Edge Servers:** Located closer to IoT devices to reduce latency and process data at the edge of the network.
- **Gateway Servers:** Serve as intermediaries between IoT devices and cloud infrastructure, aggregating and transmitting data.
