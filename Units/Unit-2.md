## Roles of Sensors and Actuators, Types of Sensors: Active and Passive ,Analog and Digital, Contact and No-contact, Absolute and Relative

### Roles of Sensors and Actuators

**Sensors** are devices that detect and measure physical properties such as temperature, pressure, light, or motion and convert them into signals that can be read by an observer or an instrument.

**Role of Sensors:**
- ``Data Collection``: Measure and provide data on environmental or system conditions.
- ``Monitoring``: Track variables like temperature, pressure, or motion.
- ``Feedback``: Supply information to control systems for adjustments.
- ``Safety & Security``: Detect and alert on conditions like intrusions or hazards.

**Actuators** are devices that perform actions based on the signals they receive from a control system or microcontroller. They convert electrical signals into physical actions, such as movement or force.

**Role of Actuators:**
- ``Action Execution``: Perform physical actions based on commands.
- ``Movement Control``: Operate mechanisms like motors or valves.
- ``Process Adjustment``: Modify processes based on sensor data.
- ``User Interaction``: Enable manual or automated adjustments and controls.

> Note: Sensors are hardware devices that measure physical parameters, while actuators are hardware devices that carry out actions based on requests in the Internet of Things (IoT) systems.

### Types of Sensors: Active and Passive, Analog and Digital, Contact and No-contact, Absolute and Relative.

#### Active and Passive Sensors:

- **Active Sensors**: These sensors emit energy (e.g., light, sound) and measure the response from the environment. Examples include radar sensors and ultrasonic sensors. Active sensors are often used in applications where the sensor needs to provide its own source of energy for measurement.

  - ``Ultrasonic Sensors``: Measure distance by emitting ultrasonic waves and detecting the time it takes for the waves to return.
  - ``Radar Sensors``: Use radio waves to detect objects and measure their speed, distance, and movement.
  - ``LIDAR Sensors``: Emit laser pulses and measure the time it takes for the pulses to reflect back, used for distance measurement and 3D mapping.

- **Passive Sensors**: These sensors detect natural energy emitted or reflected by objects without emitting any energy themselves. Examples include temperature sensors and photodiodes. Passive sensors rely on the energy available in the environment.

  - ``Thermocouples``: Measure temperature by detecting the voltage generated at the junction of two different metals.
  - ``Photodiodes``: Measure light intensity by detecting the amount of light falling on them and converting it into an electrical current.
  - ``Infrared Sensors``: Measure heat emitted by objects to determine their temperature or presence.

#### Analog and Digital:

- **Analog Sensors**: Provide a continuous output signal that varies with the measured quantity. Examples include thermocouples and potentiometers. The output is a variable voltage or current that corresponds to the measured value.

  - ``Potentiometers``: Measure angular position or displacement by varying resistance.
  - ``Strain Gauges``: Measure deformation or strain on an object by detecting changes in electrical resistance.
  - ``Analog Temperature Sensors (e.g., LM35)``: Provide a continuous voltage output proportional to the temperature.

- **Digital Sensors**: Provide discrete output signals, typically in binary form (``0s`` and ``1s``). Examples include digital temperature sensors and encoders. The output is a digital representation of the measured quantity, making it easier to interface with digital systems.

  - ``Digital Temperature Sensors (e.g., DS18B20)``: Provide temperature readings in a digital format.
  - ``Digital Accelerometers (e.g., ADXL345)``: Measure acceleration in one or more axes and provide digital output.
  - ``Encoders``: Measure rotational position or speed and provide digital output.

#### Contact and No-contact

- **Contact Sensors**: Require physical contact with the measured object or surface. These sensors measure properties through direct interaction with the object.

  - ``Pressure Sensors``: Measure the force exerted on a surface and require direct contact with the surface.
  - ``Tactile Sensors``: Detect physical touch or pressure applied to a surface.

- **Non-contact Sensors**: Measure properties without physical contact with the object. Non-contact sensors are useful for measuring objects at a distance or in situations where contact is not feasible.

  - ``Infrared Sensors``: Measure the heat emitted by objects or detect motion without physical contact.
  - ``Capacitive Sensors``: Detect changes in capacitance caused by the presence of an object without direct contact.
  - ``Laser Distance Sensors``: Measure distance by detecting the reflection of laser light without physical contact.

#### Absolute and Relative

**Absolute Sensors**: Provide a measurement that is referenced to a fixed point or absolute standard. The measurement is independent of other variables or conditions.

  - ``Absolute Pressure Sensors``: Measure pressure relative to a perfect vacuum.
  - ``Absolute Encoders``: Provide a unique position value within a full rotation, referenced to a fixed point.

**Relative Sensors**: Provide measurements relative to a reference point or another measurement. The output depends on the change or difference from a reference point.

  - ``Relative Humidity Sensors``: Measure humidity relative to the maximum amount of moisture that the air can hold at a given temperature.
  - ``Relative Position Sensors``: Measure position relative to a reference point or another position.

## Working of sensors: Position, occupancy and motion, velocity and acceleration, force, pressure, flow, Acoustic, Humidity, light, radiation, temperature, chemical, biosensor, camera.

  - **`void loop()`**: Contains the main code that runs repeatedly after setup.
- Example code to blink an LED:
  ```c
  void setup() {
    pinMode(13, OUTPUT);  // Set pin 13 as output (usually connected to onboard LED)
  }

  void loop() {
    digitalWrite(13, HIGH);  // Turn the LED on
    delay(1000);             // Wait for 1 second
    digitalWrite(13, LOW);   // Turn the LED off
    delay(1000);             // Wait for 1 second
  }
  ```
